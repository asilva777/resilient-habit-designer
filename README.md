ðŸ§  Resilient Habit Designer
The Resilient Habit Designer is an interactive web tool based on BJ Fogg's Behavior Design Model. It helps individuals create strong, flexible habits by guiding them through a simple, step-by-step process grounded in behavioral science.

ðŸ“˜ Behavior Design Model
The foundation of this tool is the formula:

ini
Copy
Edit
B = MAP
B = Behavior

M = Motivation

A = Ability

P = Prompt

To stop an unwanted behavior, reverse the formula:

ini
Copy
Edit
B = M - A - P
By reducing one or more of these components, undesired behaviors can be effectively disrupted.
